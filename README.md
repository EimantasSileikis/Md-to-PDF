GitHub Readme file converter to PDF
=====================================

Convert all readme files in repository to PDF.

Convert functionality uses GitHub action that finds all README.md files 
and runs script that launches the headless browser using puppeteer and 
exports readme files as PDFs.

Motivation
----------

Sometimes you just want to share project documentation inside readme
file with non-technical people that prefer PDF instead of MD files.
